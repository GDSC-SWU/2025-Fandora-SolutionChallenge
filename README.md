## ⭐ About Fandora
🎉 Welcome to Fandora! 🎉

We are an app that mediates album donations to tackle the album waste issue in the K-pop industry ♻️.

The K-pop industry in South Korea encourages unnecessary and excessive album purchases for profit 💸. Their albums, often made with special materials are difficult to recycle 😥, leading to the disposal of thousands to tens of thousands of albums annually 🗑️.

We aim to solve this problem by helping individual fans donate their extra albums to social enterprises or welfare organizations in the music field 🤝.

Users can:

📍 Find nearby social enterprises or welfare organizations.

🎁 Donate the albums they need.

💌 Check reviews after album donations.

🏆 See the most donated album artists.

Ready to move towards the sustainable development of the K-pop with Fandora? 🌱 We are waiting for you! 😊
